--sounditem definition file, format is same as sounds.lua in <game folder>/gamedata, but some custom parameters are added that are used
--only be the ambient player

-- rnd: sound is played once this many seconds, on average. 1 means always (loop), 0 or negative means never

-- length: length of the track in seconds, if you want a track to be played multiple times in parallel, 
-- enter something lower than the actual length, or set the offset to negative
-- you also might want to set this to somewhat lower than the actual size for seamless transition of loops
-- (warning: do not set this to 0 with looped tracks)

-- offset: seconds before this track is played wether its looped or random, for the most part this will just be added to the track length
-- when considering if its eligible to be played
-- (can be negative)
